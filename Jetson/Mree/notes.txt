Pree's primary loop is Feeling, Intuiting
 'Emotional Reactor Loop' : Energy, Trust, Warmth, Focus, Curiosity
  1. Sensors and state influence emotional state
  2. Emotional state influences behavior drives
  3. Behavior then influences sensors
 [Emotional State To Drives]
  Low Energy -> +Drive FindFocusSoft
  Low Trust -> +Drive Retreat
  Low Warmth -> +Drive lower curiosity
  Low Focus -> lower curiosity
  Low Curiosity -> +Drive lower energy
  High Energy -> +Drive FindFocusHard
  High Trust -> +Drive Closer
  High Warmth -> +Drive Closer
  High Focus -> +Drive Play
  High Curiosity -> +Drive Play
 [Drives]
  Strongest urge wins




 If pree is low, pree looks for things of interest
  with people or animals, do engagement
 more than 6 people scares pree?
