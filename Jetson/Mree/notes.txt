 Effectors
 Sensor + Trait = Feeling
 Effector + Trait = Impulse
 Feeling + Impulse + Expression = Emotion

  Memory - temporary and permanent... permanent storage
  Takes pictures when very happy and sees people

Foxen Use Cases:
* "Bootstrap" : Use the linux desktop, python editor, arduino ide & burner to serve as dev environment.
* "Watch Us" :  Use People-Tracking to follow dancers movements, keeping them in frame and center.   Either intrinsically record, or place iPad into holder
* "Guard Mode" : Sits and records any sound spikes, with timecode.
* "Play Music" : Play music through speakers.
* "Read To Me" : vocoder reads things out loud
* "Disco Ball" : Sound responsive input into the light strips(volume driven probably)
* "Learn Pose" : Record a given pose to the db
* "Self-Charge" Go to charging station and recharge.
* Tricks:
 * "Lights On" : Turns leds on with bright white.
 * "Do Your Dance" : Run through lightshow/steps sequence.
 * "Greet Everyone" : One by one, nod to each person
 * "Shake" : Sit and lift paw and shake it.
 * "Find Me" : Look around until finding person.
 * "Fetch" : Find an orange velcro ball and retrieve it
 * "Doggy Friend" : Food dispenser to feed dog treats.

Tuesday TODO:
 x works Investigate serial transmission of whole sequences
 x Change existing xree.py to not block on serial wait
 Take out garbage
 x File share system works
 Design pose system

Upgrades:
 * li-ion batteries for Xree : soldered.. if needed?
 * Spot upgrades: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4155673/files
 * Better backplate
 * Mastery of plugin cables
 * Arduino voice recog: https://www.ardumotive.com/how-to-use-a-voice-recognition-module.html

 * I2C multiplexer https://www.adafruit.com/product/2717?
 * Cable wrap servo wires
 * Servo ears
 * Servo tail
 * Double battery
 * Touch sensor on paws
 * 'Light' command - turn on white light leds
 * 'Video' command - capture video, turning head to watch

Pree's primary loop is Feeling, Intuiting
 'Emotional Reactor Loop' : Energy, Trust, Warmth, Focus, Curiosity
  1. Sensors and state influence emotional state
  2. Emotional state influences behavior drives
  3. Behavior then influences sensors
 [Emotional State To Drives]
  Low Energy -> +Drive FindFocusSoft
  Low Trust -> +Drive Retreat
  Low Warmth -> +Drive lower curiosity
  Low Focus -> lower curiosity
  Low Curiosity -> +Drive lower energy
  High Energy -> +Drive FindFocusHard
  High Trust -> +Drive Closer
  High Warmth -> +Drive Closer
  High Focus -> +Drive Play
  High Curiosity -> +Drive Play
 [Drives]
  Strongest urge wins


 If pree is low, pree looks for things of interest
  with people or animals, do engagement
 more than 6 people scares pree?
  Emotional Matrix?


 States
   NRG Hue
  [0     ] Starting - bootup procedures
  [0     ] Sleeping - booted but dormant
  [n     ] Testing - self checking
  [1     ] Resting - active but no motors
  [2     ] Searching - look about for focus
  [3     ] Focusing - interacting with focus
  [3     ] Reciting - dancing, sequences, etc
  [4     ] Playing - interacting with friendly
  [n     ] Freezing - immediately stopping in place
  Events
   Ultrasonic bump - yellow/warning flash
   See person - more excitement/energy
  Emotional Palette:
   White+Blue : Clearheaded
   Red : Aggressive
   Blue+Orange: Nostalgic
   Purple+Green: Ready to party
   Green: Trusting
